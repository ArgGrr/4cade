# List of candidates for self-running 'captive' demos
#
# Not all games are good candidates. Some have no demo mode at all. Others
# technically have one but it's visually uninteresting or too short. Still
# others are ruled out by technical constraints. Due to the architecture of
# the launcher, all self-running demos must run entirely in main memory.
# NO languard card, NO auxmem!
#
# We have enough disk space that we don't worry too much about it. (Wow.)
# Generally we start with an uncompressed ProDOS port of the entire game
# and whittle it down to just the files it needs for its demo mode, then
# apply patches so that it
#
# - returns control after the natural end of the demo cycle
# - returns control on any keypress
# - returns control on any button press (note: some games don't support
#   joystick buttons at all, and we don't add button support, but if you
#   can start the game by pressing a button, we need to ensure that that
#   returns control instead)
# - disables all sound output
#
# 'Returning control' involves activating RAM bank 1 read access and
# jumping indirectly to ($FFFC), which points to the routine labeled as
# |Reenter| in the source code. The launcher puts this code at $0100 before
# executing a self-running demo, so generally you can just put 'JMP $0100'
# anywhere you can find 3 bytes. If a particular game overwrites this area
# of the stack page, you will need to find 6 bytes for the instructions
# 'LDA $C088 / JMP ($FFFC)' yourself.
